# Face Mask Detection with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on building a face mask detection system using deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective is to identify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in images.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collected a dataset of images containing individuals with and without face masks.

2. **Model Development:**
   - Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow for face mask detection.

3. **Training:**
   - Trained the model on the collected dataset, fine-tuning parameters for optimal performance.

4. **Testing:**
   - Evaluated the model's accuracy and performance on a separate test dataset.

## Tools Used

- Python for coding and script execution.
- TensorFlow for building and training the deep learning model.
